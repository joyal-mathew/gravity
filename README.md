# gravity

Simulates gravity and optionally elastic collisions.
Controls:

 - Play/Pause
 - `G` controls the gravitational constant, essentially the strength of the attraction (does not have to be positive).
 - Elastic collisions between bodies can be turned on or off.
 - Radius and density of an added body can be set.
 - Press `Add Body` to pause the simulation and insert a body. Click down where you want to put the body then drag the mouse to set its velocity.
 - Presets will clear the current universe and insert a new one.
